### Big Data with example and types
Ans: Big data is defined as data that has greater variety, arriving at a higher velocity and in larger volumes.
Examples: 
-	Netflix’s recommendation based on collecting the persons likes and recently watched list.
-	Tracking customer’s behavior and purchasing pattern to make customized suggestions for every individual liking.
-	Collecting GPS information from every individual to generate traffic, weather and other reports.
Big data is sorted into 3 main types:
1.	Structured: The Big Data that is stored in fixed format.
  -	A specific schema holds the data together, so that all the data has same properties. 
  -	for example: Birthday, Address.

2.	Semi-Structured: The data that doesn’t follow any certain schema or has a relational format comes under semi-structured.
  -	For example: online images and videos, Xml, Json.

3.	Unstructured: Data that doesn’t fall into above two comes under Unstructured.
  -	Unstructured data includes video, audio, text, audio, webpages, etc.
  -	Unstructured data is not bound to a consistent data model, in contrast to structured and semi-structured data, which may be queried and searched consistently.

### 6 ‘V’s of Big Data (define each)
Ans:
1.	Volume:
-	This indicates the large amount of data that is continuously available for collecting from a wide range of sources and devices.

2.	Velocity:
-	In Big data, velocity refers to the speed at which the data is collected.

3.	Variety:
-	It means the data is coming from a various source, it can be structured, un-structured and semi-structured.

4.	Veracity: 
-	Controlling the data's correctness and quality can be challenging due to its capacity for being dirty and noisy. While smaller datasets might give an incomplete picture, larger datasets might be complicated and misleading.

5.	Variability: 
-	Constant changes in the meaning of the data that have been collected can cause inconsistency.

6.	Value: 
-	It is key to determine the purpose of the data collected.

### Phases of Big Data analysis (discuss each)
Ans: The 5 phases of Big Data Analysis include: 
1.	Define your Goals:
You must first choose your intended use for the data before you can begin to gather it. Spend some time considering a particular business issue you wish to tackle or a theory that might be supported by data. From there, you'll develop a list of precise, specific goals that will assist you in resolving this issue.

2.	Data collection: 
After you've established what you want to do, it's necessary to specify the kind of data you'll need in order to find the solutions and the sources from which you'll get it.

3.	Data cleaning:
After gathering and combining data from many sources, it's time to clean the data up so that it is accessible, readable, and useful. This method involves eliminating inaccurate data and looking for gaps or inconsistencies. Because the quality of your data will determine how accurate your analysis is, data cleaning is an essential stage in the data analysis process.

4.	Analyzing the data: 
You'll start to interpret your data in this step, in order to get useful insights. You can employ a variety of data analysis methods and procedures.
 -	Exploratory analysis: This the first step in your analysis which uncovers the insighs about the data, if the collected data is appropriate for your problem.
 - Descriptive analysis: This will answer the question “what happened?”, it will show what is working well and what needs to be improved.
 -	Diagnostic analysis: This will answer the question “why did this happen?”, this involves detecting correlation between the data.
 -	Predictive analysis: This will answer “will this happen again?”, this determines what is going to happen in the future based on past data.
 -	Prescriptive analysis: This will answer “what should we do?”, this will determine the best solution for the problem based on past occurrences.


5.	Visualizing the results:
The next stage is to develop data visualizations after you've analyzed the findings and gained valuable insights from them. I this step we use analyzing tools like Tableau and PowerBI to create visualizations.

### Challenges in Big Data analysis (discuss each)
1.	Lack of data talent and skills: 
Data scientists, data analysts, and data engineers are in high demand and among the highest-paid employees in the IT sector, yet they are hard to come by. One of the main obstacles to gaining value from big data environments is a lack of big data expertise and familiarity with advanced data tools.
2.	Speed of data growth:
Big data is a type of field that is constantly changing and evolving. It can become very challenging to maintain without a strong infrastructure in place that can handle your processing, storage, network, and security needs.
3.	Problems with data quality:
The quality of decision-making, data analytics, and planning methods are all directly impacted by the quality of the data. Raw data is disorganized and might be challenging to work with. Big data alone won't produce outcomes unless it is accurate, pertinent, and organized for analysis.
4.	Compliance violations:
Big data contains a lot of sensitive information, making it difficult to continuously ensure that data processing and storage adhere to data privacy and regulatory requirements.
5.	Integration complexity:
Most of the major companies use data across various systems and applications across the organization. If you want to extract any value from your big data, integrating various data sources and making data accessible for business users is difficult but essential.
6.	Security concerns:
Big data stores are valuable targets for attackers because they contain valuable business and customer information. It can be challenging to put in place comprehensive strategies and policies to protect these datasets because of their diversity and complexity.
